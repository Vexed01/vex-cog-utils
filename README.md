# Vex-Cog-Utils

Utility functions for the Vex-Cogs repo, for Red-DiscordBot

There is nothing stopping you from using this in your own cogs, however some of the stuff here is geared towards my cogs.

Docstrings fully document each function.

These are synced to bundled files with a GitHub Actions workflow on my main cog repository.

## Versioning

``major.minor.patch``

Major releases are likely to include breaking changes. There **can** me breaking changes in minor releases. There will be nothing breaking in patch releases.
